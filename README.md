## Installation

Put the files on your web server and that's it.

There are 2 ways to write articles:

1. Your can write your blog articles with Markdown syntax, with filenames like this:

        /articles
          |--- 20171114-welcomeonmyblog#news#hello.txt
          |--- 20171008-secondarticle#news.txt      
               ^         ^             ^              
               |         |             |
               |         |             tags (optional)
               |         |
               |         URL of the article
               |  
               date

2. Use the editor               

## Why another blog generator ?

I do like the "single-PHP-file" approach because it allows me to see how things work in a short time. Less is more.
