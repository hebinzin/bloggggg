## Installation

Put the files on your web server and that's it.

Your can write your blog articles with Markdown syntax, with filenames like this:

    /articles
      |--- 01-welcomeonmyblog#news#hello.txt
      |--- 02-secondarticle#news.txt      
           ^      ^        ^              
           |      |        |
           |      |        tags (optional)
           |      |
           |      URL of the article (optional)
           |  
           numbers that allow to display the articles in a chronological order 

## Why another static documentation generator ?

I do like the "single-PHP-file" approach because it allows me to see how things work in a short time. Less is more.
